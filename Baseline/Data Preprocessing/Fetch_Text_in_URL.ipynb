It ignored repeated default notices in which the lessors expressly reserved their rights and remedies under the leases, including to terminate the leasing of the aircraft and repossess the aircraft.\"\n","\n","The leasing companies said they \"repeatedly advised that the continuing arrears were unacceptable.\"\n","\n","They also denied that the seizures were related to a more profitable deal with a third-party.\n","\n","\"In fact, it took the defendants several months and significant cost ... to re-market and restore the aircraft to a suitable condition before they could be re-leased or sold,\" the document stated.\n","\n","\"Two aircraft required major repairs because one or more of their engines were unserviceable due to defects uncovered post recovery from Flair.\"\n","\n","In a statement, Flair CEO Maciej Wilk called the counterclaim a \"predictable response\" to Flair's lawsuit.\n","\n","\"The company does not comment on active litigation, but would like to point out that the claims in question relate to events that occurred over two years ago,\" Wilk said.\n","\n","\"Flair continues to maintain and cultivate productive and positive relationships with all of its stakeholders, including its customers, lessors and other industry partners and remains focused on executing its strategy and commitment to be Canada's most reliable and affordable airline.\"\n"]}],"source":["from newspaper import Article\n","import nltk\n","\n","# Download the punkt tokenizer once\n","nltk.download('punkt')\n","\n","def extract_news_text(url):\n","    try:\n","        article = Article(url)\n","        article.download()\n","        article.parse()\n","        #article.nlp()  # Optional, for summary/keywords\n","\n","        print(\"Title:\", article.title)\n","        print(\"\\nText:\\n\", article.text)\n","        #print(\"\\nSummary:\\n\", article.summary)\n","    except Exception as e:\n","        print(\"Failed to extract article:\", e)\n","\n","if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n","    url = input(\"Enter news article URL: \")\n","    extract_news_text(url)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"7f1d1493","metadata":{"id":"7f1d1493"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"e049ac41","metadata":{"id":"e049ac41"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"myenv","language":"python","name":"myenv"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.23"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
