# Abstractive-Summary-Image-Generation-Model_APS360

We have uploaded our Google Colab files for the Baseline model, the Image Retrieval module, and our text summarizers (Model 02 and Model 04).  

The **Full Pipeline Google Colab file** connects all components and generates the final PDF output. We have also provided two sample outputs:  
- One with 30 articles  
- One with 5 articles (using only unseen data)  

All necessary models, datasets, and supporting files can be accessed through our Google Drive:
